    "description": "You wake up in a dimly lit study. Dust motes swirl through shafts of light.\nA tall bookshelf lines the wall. A worn armchair sits by a cold fireplace.\nA large desk holds a brass lamp, a note, and a strange box.\nAn iron door blocks your escape, beside it glows a numeric keypad.",
    "note": "They are not just booksâ€”they speak. Listen well:\nThird from Poe, fifth from Shelley, first from Doyle, fourth from Verne.\nTheir voices will unlock the way.",
